# Pre-EMI Mode vs Full EMI Mode

Let’s simulate your **total cash outflow** for a **₹1.6 Cr loan**, 8.5% annual interest, **20-year tenure** after full disbursement, with a **5-year construction period**.

We’ll compare:

1. **Pre-EMI Mode** (interest-only during construction)
2. **Full EMI Mode** (start full EMI from day 1, even if disbursement is partial)

---

### **Assumptions**

* Loan amount: ₹1.6 Cr
* Rate: 8.5% (0.007083 monthly)
* Tenure after possession: 20 years
* Disbursement schedule:

  * Year 1: ₹40L
  * Year 2: +₹40L (total ₹80L)
  * Year 3: +₹40L (total ₹1.2 Cr)
  * Year 4: +₹20L (total ₹1.4 Cr)
  * Year 5: +₹20L (total ₹1.6 Cr)
* EMI after possession: ₹1,38,400 (for ₹1.6 Cr, 20 years at 8.5%)

### **Scenario 1: Pre-EMI Mode**

**Years 1–5:** Pay interest on disbursed amount only.

| Year | Disbursed Amount | Monthly Interest | Annual Interest |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 1    | ₹40L             | ₹28,333          | ₹3.40 L         |
| 2    | ₹80L             | ₹56,666          | ₹6.80 L         |
| 3    | ₹1.2 Cr          | ₹85,000          | ₹10.20 L        |
| 4    | ₹1.4 Cr          | ₹99,166          | ₹11.90 L        |
| 5    | ₹1.6 Cr          | ₹1,13,333        | ₹13.60 L        |

**Total Pre-EMI in 5 years:**
₹3.40 + ₹6.80 + ₹10.20 + ₹11.90 + ₹13.60 = **₹45.90 L**

After 5 years, start full EMI:

* ₹1.38 L/month for 20 years → **₹3.32 Cr** total (₹1.72 Cr interest).

**Total Outflow (Scenario 1):**
₹45.9 L (Pre-EMI) + ₹3.32 Cr = **₹3.78 Cr**
**Total Interest:** ₹1.72 Cr + ₹45.9 L = **₹2.18 Cr**

---

### **Scenario 2: Full EMI Mode**

Start full EMI (₹1.38 L) from Year 1 on full sanctioned amount.

* EMI for 20 years: ₹3.32 Cr (₹1.72 Cr interest).
* But you **repay principal from day 1**, so after 5 years, your outstanding is lower (\~₹1.32 Cr instead of ₹1.6 Cr).

After 5 years, continue EMI until completion (same ₹1.38 L), so **total tenure remains 20 years from day 1** (not 20 years after possession).

**Total Outflow:** Still \~₹3.32 Cr (but you save \~₹36 L interest vs Pre-EMI mode).

---

### **Comparison**

| Mode          | Total Outflow | Total Interest |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Pre-EMI Mode  | ₹3.78 Cr      | ₹2.18 Cr       |
| Full EMI Mode | ₹3.32 Cr      | ₹1.72 Cr       |

✅ **You save \~₹46 lakh** by starting full EMI early.

---

#### **Takeaways**

* If you can afford ₹1.38 L/month from the beginning, choose **Full EMI Mode**.
* If cash flow is tight, go with **Pre-EMI Mode**, but **switch to full EMI early** once 70–80% disbursed.
* Always **prepay whenever possible** to reduce interest drastically.
