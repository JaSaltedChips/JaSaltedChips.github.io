A beginner must first learn and follow ETF before starting to invest.

1. **Understand ETFs**  
   - ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment funds that track indices, commodities, bonds, or a mix of assets.  
   - Learn the difference between broad-market ETFs (e.g., MSCI World, S&P 500) and sector-specific or thematic ETFs.  

2. **Follow and Track ETFs**  
   - Use platforms like JustETF (for Europe), Morningstar, or your brokerâ€™s research section.  
   - Follow popular ETFs like iShares MSCI World, Vanguard S&P 500, or Invesco Nasdaq 100 to understand their behavior.  

3. **Learn Key Metrics**  
   - **Expense Ratio**: Lower is better.  
   - **Tracking Error**: Measures how well an ETF follows its index.  
   - **Liquidity & Spread**: Highly traded ETFs have lower transaction costs.  
   - **Dividend Yield**: Some ETFs distribute dividends.  

4. **Use a Demo Account**  
   - Open a demo account with a German broker like Trade Republic, Scalable Capital, or ING to practice tracking ETFs *without real money*.  

5. **Stay Updated**  
   - Follow financial news (Bloomberg, Handelsblatt, ETF.com) and macroeconomic trends affecting ETFs.  

6. **Consider an Investment Strategy**  
   - Decide between lump-sum investing or a monthly savings plan (Sparplan). Many German brokers offer ETF savings plans with no commission.
