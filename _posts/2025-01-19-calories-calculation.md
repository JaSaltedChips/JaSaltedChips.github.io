Small changes lead to big results. Hereâ€™s how Iâ€™m working on personal growth...

**Caloric Needs (Daily)** in a clear and practical way.

---

## **1. What Are Caloric Needs?**

Your body needs **energy (calories)** to stay alive and do everythingâ€”from breathing and thinking to walking and lifting weights. These needs are split into:

* **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**: Calories your body needs at rest.
* **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**: BMR plus calories burned through daily activities (walking, working out, etc.).

---

## **2. Your Numbers (Based on 33 yrs, 70kg, 175cm)**

### a. **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**

This is the number of calories you'd burn **if you did nothing all day**.
Using the Mifflin-St Jeor formula:

> **BMR â‰ˆ 10Ã—weight + 6.25Ã—height âˆ’ 5Ã—age + 5**
> **= 10Ã—70 + 6.25Ã—175 âˆ’ 5Ã—33 + 5 = 1650 kcal/day**

### b. **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**

This adds activity level to your BMR. For a moderately active person (light workouts 4â€“5 times/week), multiply BMR by **1.4â€“1.5**:

> **TDEE â‰ˆ 1650 Ã— 1.5 = \~2475 kcal/day**

So you burn roughly **2400â€“2500 kcal/day** just by living and moving around.

## **3. Caloric Goal Based on Your Objective**

You want to **gain muscle** and **lose tummy fat**. This means:

* Not a huge surplus (which adds fat)
* But enough extra calories to build muscle

### ðŸ‘‰ Target: **2600 kcal/day**

* This is a slight surplus (\~100â€“200 kcal/day over TDEE)
* Helps you build muscle without gaining too much fat

---

## **4. Why It Matters**

* If you **eat too few calories**: Youâ€™ll lose weight, but also muscle â†’ look skinny, not strong
* If you **eat too many**: Youâ€™ll gain fat, especially in the tummy
* The **right surplus** with training = muscle growth + gradual fat reduction

## âœ… Summary

| Type              | Calories/day | Purpose                           |
| ----------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **BMR**           | \~1650 kcal  | Energy needed to survive at rest  |
| **TDEE**          | \~2400 kcal  | Energy burned with daily activity |
| **Target Intake** | \~2600 kcal  | Slight surplus for muscle gain    |
