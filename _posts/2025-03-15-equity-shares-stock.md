Imagine a company called "TechGenius Inc." Here's how stock, shares, and equity would play out:

### 1. Equity
Think of **equity** as the total value of TechGenius Inc. that belongs to its owners (the shareholders). For example:
- TechGenius Inc. owns assets like office buildings, patents, and cash worth €10 million.
- The company also owes €3 million in loans and other liabilities.
- So, **Equity = Total Assets - Total Liabilities = €10 million - €3 million = €7 million.**

This €7 million represents the value of the company that can be claimed by shareholders.

### 2. Stock
Now, TechGenius Inc. decides to raise money from investors by issuing **stock**, which represents ownership in the company. 
- They divide their equity (€7 million) into smaller portions called **shares**. 
- Let’s say the company issues **1 million shares** in total.

When someone buys stock in TechGenius Inc., they are purchasing a piece of the company’s ownership.

### 3. Shares
Each individual portion of stock is called a **share**. For example:
- If you buy **1,000 shares** of TechGenius Inc., you now own 1,000 out of 1,000,000 shares, or 0.1% of the company.
- If the total equity is €7 million, your 1,000 shares represent a proportional value of **€7,000** (0.1% of the equity).

### Putting it Together:
- **Equity** is the total ownership value of the company (€7 million in this case).
- **Stock** refers to the concept of owning a piece of the company.
- **Shares** are the individual units of stock that represent your specific ownership stake.

## **What is operating result?**

The **operating result** refers to a company’s **profit from its core business operations**, before accounting for non-operational factors like taxes, interest, or one-time gains and losses. It reflects how efficiently a company generates profit from its regular activities, such as production and sales.

In simpler terms, it’s the profit earned from doing what the company is designed to do—making and selling products or providing services—without considering external financial costs or gains.

**Formula for Operating Result:**
Operating Result = Revenue - Operating Costs (e.g., production, salaries, marketing, etc.)

For example:
- If Rheinmetall’s Weapon and Ammunition division had higher sales volume in 2024, it likely earned more revenue. Assuming their operating costs didn’t increase as much, the profit from these operations (the operating result) would naturally rise.

It’s a key indicator of the health of a company’s core business.
